    The operating system is responsible for managing the computers hardware.<br />
    As with most people I only ever used the Microsoft Windows Operating System.<br />
    This was up until last year when I was introduced to Linux.<br />
    My laptop and home PC use Windows but I use Linux on a virtual machine on my laptop.<br />
