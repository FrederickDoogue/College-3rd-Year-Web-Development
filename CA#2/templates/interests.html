    My favourite sport and main hobby is rugby. I play on the wing for the IT Carlow Women's rugby team.<br />
    I play fantasy rugby during the 6 Nations with my dad. I have yet to win.<br />
    I have tickets to see Leinster play at the RDS in December.<br />
    In 2018 I started watching American Football and have since become a fan of the Green Bay Packers.<br />
